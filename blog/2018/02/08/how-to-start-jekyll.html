    <p>Last few days, I was searching on google, and was linked to a blog page. It was build with jekyll. I have seen it couple of times. later I googled a bit more about it. and decided to give it a go :)</p>

<p>It looks maybe a bit overwhelming, but it actually is surprisingly easy.</p>

<p>Jekyll is build with ruby. so you need to have ruby, but don’t worry, you don’t need to know Ruby; I believe Mac OS have ruby installed. It is very easy to follow <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">jekyll’s</a> instructions.</p>

<p>But here I am just trying to share what i have experienced, you need to have <strong>version &gt; 2.4.</strong> as you need to install gems <strong>jekyll</strong> and <strong>bundle</strong>.</p>

<p>Once you have finished the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">Jekyll’s quick-start</a>, you should have a up and running blog. what you can do is commit all your changes and push to github. you will have a live blog for free.</p>

<h2 id="for-other-non-github-servers">For other non-github servers</h2>
<p>like me, I want to serve my blog as <strong>/blog</strong>. what should i do?</p>

<p>as we can see, the <em>_site</em> folder contains all the static files we need. what you could do it just copy files &amp; folders in <em>_site</em> to be served on your server.</p>

<p>also you could just Jekyll’s CLI command, suppose you in your blog’s directory.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;</code> the <code class="highlighter-rouge">destination</code> in the &lt;&gt; is your path like mine <code class="highlighter-rouge">../mysite/blog</code>.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: <em>because I server my blog in a seperate folder under my site. you need to update your blog’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. both *url</em> and <em>baseurl</em> should be updated accordingly. otherwise you might not be able to have proper style and viewing blog.*</p>

<p>then it will pipe the ready made html files to your site’s folder.</p>
